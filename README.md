# Homework 6

Complete a group analysis on the FFL data using the cluster.

- Use the first level results you have calculated for each subject
- Calculate a one sample t-test for each of the three lower level contrasts using FLAME1 mixed effects (`--runmode=flame1`). Put your scripts in `flame.sh` and `sbatch_flame.sh`
- Use cluster correction with a height threshold of $Z>2.3$ and cluster threshold $p < .05$
- For each contrast, create a table that lists the following information for each significant cluster (a template to fill out is in `results.md`):
	- Anatomical label and hemisphere
	- Cluster size in voxels
	- Peak Z value
	- Location of the peak Z value in mm coordinates
- Create one or more images that show your results
